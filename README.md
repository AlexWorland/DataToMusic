# DataToMusic
A desktop application that takes a file and converts it into music by means of a MIDI file. The app can also play the input file directly.

Use: 
  - Copy the file you would like to "play" into the project's root directory. 
  - Enter the file name into the "Filename to convert" field
  - Press the "Convert To Bytes" button
  - Copy the file name of the new .txt file that has been created in the project's root directory
  - Paste it into the "Filename to play/export" field
  - From here you can opt for a "live" performance by pressing "Play", export the file as a MIDI file with "Export to Midi File", or view the file as an image with "Export as Image"
  
  Of particular interest is using premade midi performances and running them through the above process which yields an interesting hybid between the orignal file, and new musical material. Other recommendations are .txt files of poems, books, or other text media. For longer performances, one can use images, zipped files, or any larger file type.
 

Note : 10/01/2020
  This has been one of my favorite projects to work on and I recently started going through it to clean it up because the current version is, frankly, a mess.
